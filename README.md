# Modern React with Redux (Update 2023) | Stephen Grider

## Course Description

This Udemy course, led by Stephen Grider, provided a comprehensive introduction to the fundamentals and advanced concepts of React and Redux. Over the course, we built eight practical React apps, covering the following concepts:

### Concepts and Technologies

1. **Nesting Reusable Functional Components:**
   - Creating and structuring components that can be reused multiple times to keep the code clean and modular.

2. **Data Flow Using Prop System:**
   - Passing data between components via props to ensure communication and data flow within the application.

3. **Interactions Using Event-Handler System:**
   - Implementing user interactions using event handlers to respond to user actions like clicks and inputs.

4. **Hooks and Customized Hooks:**
   - Using React hooks to manage state and side effects in functional components. Customized hooks were created to encapsulate reusable logic.

5. **Routes:**
   - Using React Router to enable navigation and routing within the application.

6. **State Management with useState and useReducer:**
   - Managing simple states with useState. For more complex states, useReducer was employed to keep the logic centralized and clear.

7. **useEffect for External Interactions:**
   - Utilizing useEffect to interact with external data sources such as APIs.

8. **useContext:**
   - Providing global states and functions via useContext to avoid prop drilling.

9. **useCallback for Performance Improvement:**
   - Using useCallback to optimize application performance by ensuring functions are only recreated when necessary.

10. **API Integration and CRUD Actions:**
    - Integrating APIs and JSON Server to fetch, store, and manage data. CRUD actions (Create, Read, Update, Delete) were thoroughly covered.

11. **State Management with Redux-Store:**
    - Gaining a deep understanding of the Redux store, including the creation and management of global states.

12. **Async Thunk Functions and Redux-Toolkit-Query:**
    - Handling asynchronous operations with thunks. Creating APIs and automatic data re-fetching using Redux-Toolkit-Query.
